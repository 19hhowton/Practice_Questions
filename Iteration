    fizz
    4
    buzz
    
    
🌶️🌶️ Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.*Expected Output:*
Input lengths of the triangle sides:
    x: 6
    y: 8
    z: 12
    Scalene triangle
