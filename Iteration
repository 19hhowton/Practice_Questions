### There are types you can iterate in a for loop: string, list, a list produced by range, dictionary, etc. 

🌶️ 1. Print all the 💚numbers💚 from 0 to 5 using a for loop.
        a. Using a list [0,1,2,3,4,5]
        b. Using range
Sample Output:
    0
    1
    ...
    5


🌶️ Print all the 💚numbers💚 from 2 to 7 using a for loop. 
        a. Using a list [2,3,4,5,6,7]
        b. Using range
Sample Output:
    2
    3
    ...
    9

🌶️Print all each letter in the 🟠list🟠 'R', 'o', 's', 'e', ' ', 'H', 'o', 'w', 't', 'o', 'n'], using a for loop.
        a. Using the list: ['R', 'o', 's', 'e', ' ', 'H', 'o', 'w', 't', 'o', 'n']
        b. Using range with the length of the string
Sample Output:
    N
    O
    ...
    O
    R
    
🌶️Print all each letter in the 🟠list🟠 ['R', 'o', 's', 'e', ' ', 'H', 'o', 'w', 't', 'o', 'n','12312312'] backwards, using a for loop.
        a. Using the list: ['R', 'o', 's', 'e', ' ', 'H', 'o', 'w', 't', 'o', 'n','12312312']
        b. Using range with the length of the string
Sample Output:
    N
    O
    ...
    O
    R

🌶️Print all each letter in the 🟣string🟣 "Rose Howton" using a for loop.
        a. Using the string: "Rose Howton"
        b. Using range with the length of the string
            Note: If you're getting numbers from b, you're missing a crutial point! 
            Hint [] <- use me to print letters using range() for strings and lists!
Sample Output:
    R
    O
    ...
    N

### Now that you know the basics of iterating through strings, list of numbers using range, and lists, time to do cool stuff with it:

🌶️Print all each letter in the 🟣string🟣 "Rose Howton" backwards, using a for loop.
        a. Using the string: "Rose Howton"
        b. Using range with the length of the string
Sample Output:
    N
    O
    ...
    O
    R

🌶️Taking the input from the user, write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
Formula : c/5 = f-32/9
User Input Example: 30F
    
    Expected Output :
    60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
    45°F is 7 in Celsius


🌶️🌶️🌶️ Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9 using the random module.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

🌶️🌶️ Write a Python program to find the Factorial.
Sample Input: 5
Expected Output: 120


🌶️ Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
*Sample Output*:
    fizzbuzz
    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    
    
🌶️🌶️ Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.*Expected Output:*
Input lengths of the triangle sides:
    x: 6
    y: 8
    z: 12
    Scalene triangle
    
    
    
🌶️🌶️ Write a Python program to find the median of three values. 
    
    Expected Output:
    
    Input first number: 15
