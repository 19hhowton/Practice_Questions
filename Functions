🌶️ Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. 
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
   
🌶️ Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


🌶️ Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list. 
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]


🌶️ Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.


🌶️ Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not. 
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
